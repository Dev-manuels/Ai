# Vision and Institutional Goals

## Overview
The Football Intelligence Platform is an institutional-grade system designed for high-frequency predictive modeling and automated risk management in sports markets. Our primary objective is to identify and exploit statistical edges with a focus on long-term expected value (EV) rather than short-term variance.

## Core Philosophy
- **Statistical Edge over Contextual Noise**: We prioritize market-based signals (odds movement, sharp bookmaker divergence) and robust Poisson-based modeling over qualitative narratives.
- **Strict Risk Control**: The system operates with a minimum 75% confidence threshold for any suggested action and utilizes fractional Kelly Criterion for stake sizing.
- **Auditability**: Every prediction is backed by a full feature snapshot, ensuring that every decision can be traced back to the exact data state at the time of inference.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The platform is optimized for the following institutional metrics:

1. **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Net profit relative to total turnover.
2. **Closing Line Value (CLV)**: Tracking our edge against sharp market closings (e.g., Pinnacle).
3. **Sharpe & Sortino Ratios**: Measuring risk-adjusted returns and downside protection.
4. **Maximum Drawdown**: Capped via automated circuit breakers (default 15%).
5. **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.

## Target Performance
- **Win Rate**: Secondary to ROI, but typically targeted at 55%+ on binary outcomes.
- **Edge Magnitude**: Targeted 3-5% consistent edge over closing prices.
- **Market Impact**: Optimized to minimize slippage in liquid leagues (EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga).
